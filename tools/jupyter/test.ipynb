After a particularly difficult implementation of an algorithm, you decide to test your code on a trivial example. It passes. You test the code on a harder problem. It passes once again. And it passes the next, *even more difficult*, test too! You are starting to believe that there may be no bugs in this code...\n\nIf you think this way, then congratulations, you already are thinking Bayesian! Bayesian inference is simply updating your beliefs after considering new evidence. A Bayesian can rarely be certain about a result, but he or she can be very confident. Just like in the example above, we can never be 100% sure that our code is bug-free unless we test it on every possible problem; something rarely possible in practice. Instead, we can test it on a large number of problems, and if it succeeds we can feel more *confident* about our code, but still not certain.  Bayesian inference works identically: we update our beliefs about an outcome; rarely can we be absolutely sure unless we rule out all other alternatives. ",

The only unfortunate part is that its documentation is lacking in certain areas, especially those that bridge the gap between beginner and hacker. One of this book's main goals is to solve that problem, and also to demonstrate why PyMC3 is so cool.\n\nWe will model the problem above using PyMC3. This type of programming is called *probabilistic programming*, an unfortunate misnomer that invokes ideas of randomly-generated code and has likely confused and frightened users away from this field. The code is not random; it is probabilistic in the sense that we create probability models using programming variables as the model's components. Model components are first-class primitives within the PyMC3 framework. \n\nB. Cronin [5] has a very motivating description of probabilistic programming:\n\n>   Another way of thinking about this: unlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward directions, a probabilistic program is run in both the forward and backward direction. It runs forward to compute the consequences of the assumptions it contains about the world (i.e., the model space it represents), but it also runs backward from the data to constrain the possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave these forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.\n\nBecause of the confusion engendered by the term *probabilistic programming*, I'll refrain from using it. Instead, I'll simply say *programming*, since that's what it really is. \n\nPyMC3 code is easy to read. The only novel thing should be the syntax. Simply remember that we are representing the model's components ($\\tau, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ ) as variables.",
